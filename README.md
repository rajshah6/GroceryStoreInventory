# GroceryStoreInventory

This program will act as a grocery store, where the user can add and save food items into a large text file, that can be manually accessed. The items will be stored into an array with a custom type using a class. User can also access the items using the SKU or Name of item. The inventory.txt file is read from inside the main method, this is the code that runs first. Then, once the buttons are clicked, the file is written to, etc.

To run the program, open the GroceryStore.java file from src, then run it. The saved groceries you enter will be saved in the inventory.txt file
